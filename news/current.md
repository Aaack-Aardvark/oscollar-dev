# First News - 2011-10-12

Hi all.  This is the first post in the new OpenCollar news system.  It uses a
Markdown-formatted static file on Github so it looks good both on the web and
inworld.

All posts should have a title line that ends in a yyyy-mm-dd date, so that the
collar can remember the last time it checked for news and only report new stuff
to you.
