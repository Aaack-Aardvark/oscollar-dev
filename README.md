### Welcome to OsCollar

OsCollar is the de-facto OpenSim fork of OpenCollar, a device for submission roleplay that originated in Second Life

#### Requirements

Simulator: OpenSim 0.9.1.0 or newer
XEngine or YEngine (YEngine strongly recommended!)

Note that as soon as YEngine becomes the default in a forthcoming OpenSim release, we will drop XEngine support. High quality grids already have set YEngine as default, or at least give simowners the option to enable it.
