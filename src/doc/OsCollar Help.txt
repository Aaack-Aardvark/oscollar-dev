OsCollar Help Card

This is only a short version of the manual, explaining the basic usage and lists all chat commands.


==============================
A word about OpenSim and script state loss
==============================

Due to OpenSim bug #8366 (http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=8366)
scripts (so also this collar) can lose state in two ways:

1 Teleport from a YEngine region to a XEngine region
2 Teleport to a hypergrid region

** BE SURE TO SAVE YOUR SETTINGS CARD AFTER ANY CHANGE OF SETTINGS!!! **
        That way the collar can recover after a script reset.

To save settings (easy):
-> Open the collar menu, Click Settings, Click Save.

If saving is not supported in this region (advanced):
-> Open the collar menu, click Unlock (if locked), click Settings, click Print
-> Select and copy the settings below the cutline from local chat
-> Edit the collar, and select the Settings link/prim
   (cycle between links with with Ctrl-. and Ctrl-, )
-> Open the ".settings" notecard within and replace what's on the notecard
   (Ctrl-A followed by Ctrl-V)
-> Save the notecard

==========
The Very Basics
==========

Making use of the many, many features in your collar can be done by touching your neck, by touching your collar directly, by using a remote or with individual chat commands.

-------------
The Prefix:
-------------

Your [prefix] are the first two letters of your username, not of your displayname

    John Doe's prefix is: jo
    Loki (silvia.blep)'s prefix is: si

Your prefix is used to issue commands in the Nearby Chat.

    [prefix] menu
    [prefix] kneel
    [prefix] stop

If you don’t like your prefix, you can change it. Only the owner can change the prefix, and the wearer if there is no owner set.

    ws prefix wen
    wr prefix we
    js prefix sex

There are two special prefixes. * issues commands to everyone nearby and # issues commands to everyone except yourself.

    *trauma
    #grab

------------
Channels:
------------

You can also issue commands on channel 1.

    /1 [prefix] menu

Or if you don’t like channel 1 set a different channel.

    [prefix] channel 2
    [prefix] channel 3
    [prefix] channel 69
    [prefix] channel 9001

If you are considerate about lag, you can also turn off the Nearby Chat listener.

    [prefix] channel -1

Too much hassle to always type a slash after all?

    /1 [prefix] channel 0

------------
Safeword:
------------

Your collar also has a safeword which you simply type in the nearby chat. This will lift all RLV restrictions, unpose and unleash you. It will also send your Owner a message to check for your well being. RED in capital letters is the default safeword.

    RED
    /1RED
    ((RED))

If that’s too hard to remember you can easily change it.

    [prefix] safeword Mayday!
    [prefix] safeword taxi
    [prefix] safeword BANANA

This works only if your RLV relay is NOT in helpless mode. (Main Menu -> RLV -> Relay -> Helpless) if Helpless mode is on the safeword option will be disabled.


===============
List of Chat Commands
===============

Alright, many asked for this and here it is, the ultimate list of nerdy chat commands for those of you who prefer them over menus, touch or HUDs! Assumed here is that you know what a prefix is. We will indicate each prefix with a hash key. Why hash key? Cause waffles!

NOTE: Wearers have to use the first two letters of their username instead of the hash key.
