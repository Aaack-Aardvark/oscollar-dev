## The Owner HUD

###### A graphical user interface for ease of access to OsCollar scripted devices.

Formerly "OpenCollar Owner HUD", this variation is vastly slimmed down and more resource friendly. There are also a lot more buttons on the device itself. The new button textures can be found in the ./res directory of this repo; they are created by and used with permission from Wendy Starfall.
