## The OpenCollar AO

###### A ZHAO II based animation overrider with graphical user interface.

Formerly "OpenCollar Sub AO", there is not much new compared to the legacy variation except that it is distributed now with share-alike button textures that can be found in the ./res directory of this repo and that it is less chatty when connecting to the OpenCollar device.


OpenSim 0.9 has server side AO functions, greatly reducing the complexity of the AO:
* oc_ao.lsl

OpenSim 0.8 does not have server side AO functons, which is much less efficient:
* oc_ao_dialog.lsl
* oc_ao_interface.lsl
* oc_ao_options.lsl
* oc_zhao_core.lsl
* oc_zhao_interface.lsl
