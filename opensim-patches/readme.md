This folder used to contain patches for OpenSim

You wouldn't believe how often I got a "bug report" for what is actually a bug in OpenSim itself. Unfortunately the core devs don't see the urgency to integrate them in mainstream OpenSim, so you'll have to patch the sourecode yourself!

So I now link you to the respective Mantis'es, where you can get the attached patches affecting collar and RLV roleplay:

[Mantis 8366](http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=8366)  
This fixes state being lost or even non-working scripts after teleporting to a hypergrid destination. If you have been wondering why your collar (and other scripted attachments) lost any and all settings, this is it.

[Mantis 6311](http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6311)  
This affects RLVa, when declining a folder given to your shared #RLV folder by a scripted object/trap

[Mantis 8250](http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=8250)
If your sub has been bunny hopping or is stuck when walking up or down a hill, stairs, or other kind of slope, this patch fixes that leash weirdness.
