# OpenCollar 3.8 is here! - 20121112.1

Hello everybody. The next OpenCollar is finally here.

A few highlights, on the user point of view:

1. The modular updater now has a web interface. Just carefully follow instructions!

2. Whene a dialog button has a too long label (long avatar name, long folder name... ),
full text for all choices will appear in the chat console.

3. New 'Actions' submenu in #RLV Browsing, making it possible to choose between adding
and replacing folders and even locking them. 2 icons before each folder name give more
info about the worn status of a folder and subfolders.

Highlights for developpers and designers:

1. The link message map has changed a lot. In the new workflow, a command chain is authed
only once. It is advised to look at the new template:

2. "touch" helper API. Different actions on touching different prims of a collar can be set,
either using prim descriptions or through an API similar to that of the dialog helper.
