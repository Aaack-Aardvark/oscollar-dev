# LL Bug Alert - 20111016

Hi all.  There's currently a [bug]
(https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/SVC-7321) in LL's code that prevents some
full perms items from transferring cleanly with llGiveInventory and
llRemoteLoadScriptPin.  You might see errors relating to this on update.  There
is supposed to be a fix currently in the regions on the "Magnum" release
channel.  

If you see the errors happen in a Magnum region, please add your comment to the
bug linked above, and IM me to let me know what failed.

Thank you!
